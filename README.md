## Technology

The following are the key technologies and tools used in the development of this app:

- **Unity**: Is a popular game development platform used to create both 2D and 3D games, interactive applications, simulations, and more. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for game design, animation development, physics, graphic rendering, audio, and more. With Unity, developers can create multiplatform games for desktop, mobile, web, and consoles. It supports multiple programming languages, including C#, JavaScript, and Boo, but C# is the most commonly used scripting language by Unity developers.
- **C#**: Is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for building applications, including games, due to its clean syntax, strong typing, automatic memory management, and extensive standard library.

## Key Features

- **Intense Shooting Action**: Dive into endless 2D space combat against relentless waves of enemy ships.
- **Dynamic Power-Ups**: Unleash devastating triple lasers, turbocharge your speed, or fortify your defenses with shields, all randomly.
- **Endless Challenge**: No levels, no stages - just survive as long as possible against endless waves of adversaries.
- **Tactical Gameplay**: Quickly adapt to the randomly appearing power-ups to maximize your effectiveness amidst chaos.
- **Three Lives to Conquer the Cosmos**: With only three lives at your disposal, every moment is crucial in your quest for galactic supremacy.

## How to Play

- **Controls**: Use the right mouse button to fire your lasers. Use the WASD keys to navigate your spacecraft through the cosmic battleground.
- **Pause**: Press the "ESC" key to pause the game at any time. Take a breather, assess the situation, and jump back into action when ready.
- **Restart on Defeat**: If your spacecraft meets its demise, fear not. The game automatically restarts, giving you another chance to dominate the cosmos.
- **Scoring System**: Rack up points with each enemy ship you obliterate. Keep track of your score as you strive to outdo your previous achievements.
- **Watch out for Asteroids**: Beware of asteroids drifting through space. Colliding with them will deplete your life count. However, you can destroy them using your laser firepower and survival.
